# Overview

For this project, I am building a map displaying earthquake data from USGS using ArcGIS. This project called QuakeMap displays earthquake incidents in an area for the past 24 hours. A filter lets the user specify which area to display the information from. If there are incidents, it will be shown by a pin on the map. Clicking on a pin will give more details on the incident in that location.
